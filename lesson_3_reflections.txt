Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. When you'd like to collborate with others on the repository. Or when you would like to get the data backed up.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. Because you might not be ready for the changes to be made in your local repository
